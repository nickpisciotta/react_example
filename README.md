# React on Rails Tutorial Part 1

* This tutorial covers some basic React concepts with a Rails backend.  Single-page web applications are becoming more and more popular, so the need for a FrontEnd frameworks and libraries that can handle DOM manipulation and maintain a state of the application helps to mitigate the complexity that comes from handling different events and data changes happening on the page. In my pursuit to further learn React, a popular FE library that helps with the aforementioned issues, I completed the first part of the 'React on Rails Tutorial' by Piotr Jaworski.

* Things learned from this tutorial:
  * Using Rails for BackEnd data storage
  * React ES5 syntax and concepts
  * Further understanding of the 'state' concept utilized by React.
  * Using React within a Rails app and getting them to communicate via AJAX requests.

* Next Steps:
  * I would like to continue with learning React, primarily on a Rails framework.
